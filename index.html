Even a seemingly simple CODASYL DML phrase can involve traversal
Many event logs and sometimes complex access analysis
Paths. These activities remain transparent to the database end user.
However, dealing with these functions with the database management system contributes greatly
To the level of performance the database user perceives (and pays for).
In this work, we explore an aspect of system performance
even this ward Database:
Database reference patterns and implications for DBMS performance. Understanding reference patterns is essential to design
Many of the DBMS components (for example, buffer management policies and query optimization)
Methods, indexing techniques, etc.). These components must be designed with
Minimize physical disk access in mind for improvement
DBMS overall performance
A We represent DBMS as a multi-layered system with three levels: Logical or DML
Level, internal level, and physical level. Similar approaches have been taken
Suggested in the literature (for example, [l, 28, 341); While the other authors focus
On the specific objects and processes in each level, we emphasize dynamics
Part of passing data. During query execution, DBMS accesses
Various data objects from the database; The way you access current data
An object from the previous is called the traversal type. Figure 1 illustrates our basic
Form.THREE-LEVEL MODEL OF DATABASE TRAVERSAL:
The first level is
CODASYL DML level or logical level. The objects selected at this level are
Records and groups, as defined in the CODASYL schema. At this level
there are three type of traversal :(1) NEXT or PRIOR-corresponds to the DML function FIND NEXT record
(WITHIN set);
(2) UP/DOWN-corresponds to the DML functions FIND FIRST member
WITHIN set, FIND LAST member WITHIN set, or FIND OWNER
WITHIN set; and
(3) DIRECT-which results from the execution of a FIND function that does
Our second level is the internal leuel. Data objects at this level are record
occurrences in their internal representation. The traversal types at the internal
level correspond to the four ways to reach an internal record in a database: 
POINTER - Uses a pointer stored in one record to access another record
Within a group. Examples of indicators are the following, previous, and owner indicators;
(2) INDEXED uses an index (for example, Tree B) to find the occurrence of the next record.
The index can be defined for a record type or for a group.
(3) Express the stored records through their physical communication. An
An example is a survey over an area; And
(4) CALCIDBKEY - Includes all types of internal travels, including use
CALC, database, and currency indicators (currency indicators)
It is usually stored in DBMS in the form of database key values).
Must be set between the mental and the inner level:
Certain traversal can be set at the logical DML level
For a variety of types of traversal internally. For example, NEXT
DML traversal can be a transition point, a pointer or a cascading transition internally, depending on the tuning mode chosen by
Database administrator. Likewise, direct traversal with a defined key
By the user
At the DML level, it can be either INDEXED traversal or CALC / DBKEY
Domestically, depending on the access path for the key chosen by
Database administrator. (Note that the 1978 DDLC specifications were quoted
CALC Keys Announced from Conceptual to Internal Diagram [6].)
The third level is physical zeol. Data objects at this level are the database
Pages. In this paper, it is assumed that the database consists of pages
Equal size and every page has a unique page number. Types of traversal on
The physical level characterizes DBMS page reference behavior:
(1) LOCALITY-Informally, locality means that recently referenced pages have
a higher probability of reference than other pages. If locality exists at the
physical level, replacement strategies from virtual memory operating systems
can be used in the DBMS buffer, since they are designed for the highly local
addressing behavior of programs. Examples of such strategies are LRU and
SECOND CHANCE [29].
(2) SEQUENTIALITY-A traversal from a page with page number i to the page
with page number i+l is called a sequential traversal. If sequentiality exists
at the physical level, prefetching strategies should be considered for buffer
management [23,30].
(3) RANDOM ACCESS-All other page accesses are called random accesses.

Update database history. Examples of internal schema options are groups of DBAdefined groups (DBMS) are attempting to place group members
Owner page (or subsequent pages), fragmentation area sizes, and initial load factors
For pages. An example of how update history affects specific groups
The sequence of uploading member records to a group; If uploaded in the specified order,
Many DBMSs will group it on successive pages.
One of the reasons maps are between interior and physical levels
Hard to understand is the potential inconsistency of options in the internal layout.
An example of this is a member record type with two different types of owner records in
Two groups (V structure), where only member records can be grouped to one group
Groups. Also, the fact that the update history is included makes it very difficult
To use a specific internal scheme to predict the actual mass properties of
CODASYL database :The motivation for our model is the following: if the appointments are between
Three levels are fully understood, physical prediction must be predictable
Referential behavior for a specific DML query. Such a prediction can be useful
Many ways. At the physical level, the buffer management component ofDBMS can make replacement decisions based on knowledge of future references.
For example, a long chain of single-page page accesses could be used
Buffer frame, rather than LRU or FIFO strategy that can fill buffer
With pages that will never be referenced
Around typical traversal on a physical level is also useful for design
Decisions related to this layer of DBMS. For example, the shadow page
The update deployment technology can be replaced by an in-place update
Technology with writing forward, if the sequence is an expected physical transmission

At the DML level, prediction technology can help improve treatment
Existing database programs with fixed internal schema. It can be used
Transactional programmers give hints with performance implications for their DML programs.
Finally, there is a better understanding of the assignments between the three criteria
Very important for the database manager. Who knows
Expected transaction load, the internal schema can be improved in the database
Design time, even before DML programs compiled and implemented.
Although we presented our model in the context of CODASYL systems,
Adaptive to hierarchical systems is a direct matter for
Relational systems, types of traversal must be redefined, perhaps
It is also useful to add a fourth level to the relational query language processor.
